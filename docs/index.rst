Treescope
=========

Treescope is an interactive HTML pretty-printer and N-dimensional array
("tensor") visualizer, designed for machine learning and neural networks
research in IPython notebooks. It's a drop-in replacement for the standard
IPython/Colab renderer, and adds support for:

* Expanding and collapsing subtrees of rendered objects, to let you focus on
  the parts of your model that you care about,
* Automatically embedding faceted visualizations of arbitrary-dimensional arrays
  and tensors directly into the output renderings, so you can quickly understand
  their shapes and the distribution of their values,
* Color-coding parts of neural network models to emphasize shared structures,
* Inserting "copy path" buttons that let you easily copy the path to any part of
  a rendered object,
* Customizing the visualization strategy to support rendering your own data
  structures,
* And more!

Treescope was originally developed as the pretty-printer for the
`Penzai neural network library <https://penzai.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_, but
it also supports rendering neural networks developed with other libraries,
including
`Equinox <https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/>`_,
`Flax NNX <https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx/index.html>`_,
and
`PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/>`_.
You can also use it with basic
`JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
and
`Numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/>`_
code.

With Treescope, instead of looking at this:

.. container:: glued-cell-output max-height-20em

  .. glue:any:: treescope_before
    :doc: _include/_glue_figures.ipynb

You could be looking at this:

.. container:: glued-cell-output

  .. glue:any:: treescope_after
    :doc: _include/_glue_figures.ipynb

Or even this:

.. container:: glued-cell-output

  .. glue:any:: treescope_penzai
    :doc: _include/_glue_figures.ipynb

These are interactive visualizations; try clicking the `â–¶` buttons to expand
parts of the output! (You can also hold shift while scrolling to
scroll horizontally instead of vertically.)

Getting Started
---------------

You can install Treescope using ::

  pip install treescope

and import it using ::

  import treescope

To render a specific object in an IPython notebook with Treescope, you can use
`treescope.show`, which is like `print` but produces a rich interactive output.

Alternatively, you can simply configure Treescope as the default pretty printer
for your notebook via ::

  treescope.register_as_default()

To turn on automatic array visualization, you can run ::

  treescope.active_autovisualizer.set_globally(treescope.ArrayAutovisualizer())

Or, if you'd like to both set up Treescope as the default pretty printer and
enable automatic array visualization, you can simply run ::

  treescope.basic_interactive_setup(autovisualize_arrays=True)

Once you've rendered an object, try clicking on it and pressing the ``r`` key!
This turns on "roundtrip mode", and adds qualified names to every type in the
visualization, making it easier to identify what the types in your object are.

.. tip::
   If Treescope's outputs are too verbose, or if you are using a terminal that
   wraps lines, you can configure Treescope to abbreviate collapsed objects at a
   given depth using ::

      treescope.basic_interactive_setup(
          autovisualize_arrays=True,
          abbreviation_threshold=1,  # or a different value
      )

   You can also configure the abbreviation threshold manually by overriding
   `treescope.abbreviation_threshold` using the ``.set_globally`` or
   ``.set_scoped`` methods.
